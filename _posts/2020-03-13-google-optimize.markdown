### Overview

Google Optimize allows you to run tests on your site and gather data to see how your site can be improved. You can run A/B tests and target different audience types to increase conversions.

### Examples of use

At Victorian Plumbing, I was making constant improvements to the site in the hope that conversions would increase and bounce rates reduced. One test in particular was the positioning of the "Shop By Category" section on the homepage. I ran an A/B test where the section was higher up and lower down the page so we could to see what layout encouraged the most conversions.

### How to Google Optimize

Google Optimize integrates with the general Google business account and other tools such as Google Analytics. Check out this [tutorial][google-optimize-ab] on how to create an A/B test in Google Optimize.
